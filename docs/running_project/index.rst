Welcome to OUTDOOR_NAV2's documentation!
========================================

A project to develop/adapt a navigation system for outdoor robotics particularly aiming for use-cases in agriculture. 


This branch(foxy) is aiming for ROS2 Foxy distro, there is also `main` branch which keeps up with the latest commits from `ros2::main` and `navigation2::main`. This branch is more stable so we aim to keep major feature developments in this branch since it is more stable. 

`main` branch unstable because of constant updates from whole ROS2 ecosystem. But it is required to be there, from time to time we may need to get involved with guys at `navigation2` e.g submitting PRs or getting/pulling latest features from navigation2. Current branch is recomended to try/test/develop.
